#ITC Hotels Revenue Optimization (Interactive Dashboard using Power BI)

##Project Objective
The goal of this project is to analyze ITC Hotels’ revenue, occupancy, booking behavior, and cancellations in order to extract actionable insights that can help optimize financial performance, occupancy trends, and customer satisfaction.
The project delivers an interactive multi-page Power BI dashboard for real-time decision-making by stakeholders.

##Key Questions (KPIs)

Key Problem Areas to Address:

Page 1: Financial Overview & Revenue Performance

1. What is the total revenue generated by ITC Hotels, and how does it vary across different hotels and room categories?
2. What is the cumulative revenue growth over time?
3. How has the revenue grown month-over-month (MoM) and week-over-week (WoW)?
4. What are the average daily rate (ADR) and revenue per available room (RevPAR)?

Page 2: Occupancy & Capacity Analysis

1. What is the occupancy rate for each hotel and room category?
2. How does occupancy fluctuate seasonally or over specific periods (e.g., weekends, holidays)?
3. What is the  occupancy growth (MoM and WoW)?
4. How does occupancy correlate with revenue and RevPAR?

Page 3: Room Category Performance & Booking Insights

1. Which room categories generate the most revenue?
2. How do booking patterns (lead time, check-in dates) affect revenue and occupancy?
3. What is the average length of stay (ALOS) for each hotel and room type?
4. What is the room revenue trend (including running total and MoM/WoW growth)?

Page 4: Cancellations & Lost Revenue Analysis

1. What is the cancellation rate for each hotel and room category?
2. How have cancellation trends changed over time (MoM/WoW)?
3. What is the lost revenue due to cancellations?
4. Are there any patterns in cancellations (e.g., specific room types, time of year)?

##Process

1. Data Cleaning & Transformation using Power BI Power Query.
2. Applied DAX formulas to create calculated columns and measures (e.g., RevPAR, ADR, MoM & WoW Growth).
3. Designed interactive dashboards with slicers, date filters, and drill-through features.
4. Incorporated KPI indicators for revenue, occupancy, cancellations, and growth rates.
5. Used charts & visuals:
Waterfall Charts → Revenue growth trends
Ribbon Charts → Room category performance ranking
Line & Bar Charts → Occupancy and booking insights

Cards & Gauges → KPIs (ADR, RevPAR, Occupancy %)
